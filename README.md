# What happens when I visit a webpage? - A Role-Play Activity

_[CiC 2021/22 - Semester 1 Contribution]_

This repo contains a lesson plan and the required materials for a role-play activity explaining the processes and interactions that happen in the background when you visit a webpage.

Each student gets to be one component (e.g. the web-server, the browser, etc.). The students then carry out tasks and exchange messages to achieve the final goal: _The delivery of a website to the user_.

### Audience

Target Age (9-15):

- Upper Primary (P5-P7)
- Lower Secondary (S1-S3)

### Learning Objectives

The main learning objective is for students to understand the process behind web-browsing. This includes:

- Understanding which components are involved
- Understanding the unique role/function that each component has
- Understanding the interaction between these components
