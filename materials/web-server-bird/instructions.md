# Web-Server - Bird105

You are the Web-Server. The Web-Server is a computer that stores all the information that are displayed on a website.
Find out what the Web-Server does by looking at the steps below.

### Who do you know?

- **Internet Connection**: Unicorn357

### Your Tasks

Wait for someone to contact you...

1. If someone contacts you they will likely ask for content of a webpage (Why? see [WKM 1](#wanna-know-more))
2. Look at the source-code stored on your server (in the src-folder) and find the source-code of the main-webpage.
3. Create an answer and attach this source-code.
   - if you can, use the .txt file (which contains actual code)
   - if you can't send it, send the picture of the source code instead
4. Return that source-code to **Internet Connection** telling it to send it back to where it came from.
   - _How does the **Internet Connection** know where the message came from?_ (see [WKM 2](#wanna-know-more))

### Optional Information

#### Wanna know more?

1. You are a webserver. There are lots of different types of servers - imagine them as computers that serve different purposes.
   Some might store files, some store webpages (like you), others sent your emails for you.
   As a webserver your purpose is to wait for requests and respond with the corresponding webpage and/or do the corresponding task, like loggin in a user.
2. We simplified this a little bit. Usually you, the component receiving a message, knows the sender as it is written on the message itself. Imagine it like a letter that is sent to you. On the one hand, it has your address to be clear where it should be delivered. On the other hand, it also states the address of where it came from. This means that you could answer this letter by sending a letter back to this address. This is how it works in the internet as well. The only difference is that the address is an _ip-address_, which you probably talked about in your lessons before.
