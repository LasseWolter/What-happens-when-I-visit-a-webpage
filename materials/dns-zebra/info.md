# Domain Name Server (DNS) - Zebra 98

You are the Domain Name Server (DNS). You help components to find the IP address (the location) of another component.
How do you do that? Look at the steps below.

### Who do you know?

- **Internet connection**: Unicorn357

### Your Tasks

Wait for someone to contact you...

1. When someone contacts you you will be asked for the ip-address of a certain domain (Why? see [WKM 1](#wanna-know-more))
2. Open dns-records.txt and look up the ip-address for the domain that **Internet Connection** has given you.
3. Create an answer containing that domain.
4. Give this answer to **Internet Connection** and tell it to send it back to where it came from
   - _How does the **Internet Connection** know where the message came from?_ (see [WKM 2](#wanna-know-more))

### Optional Information

#### Wanna know more?

1. You are a Domain-Name-Server(DNS). There are lots of different types of servers - imagine them as computers that serve different purposes.
   Some might store files, some store webpages, others sent your emails for you.
   As a Domain-Name-Sever(DNS) your purpose is to translate domain-names into ip-addresses.
   You are a bit like a look-up table
