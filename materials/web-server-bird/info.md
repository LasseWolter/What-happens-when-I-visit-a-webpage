# Web-Server - Bird105

You are the Web-Server. The Web-Server is a computer that stores all the information that are displayed on a website.
Find out what the Web-Server does by looking at the steps below.

### Who do you know?

- **Internet Connection**: Unicorn357

### Your Tasks

Wait for someone to contact you...

1. If someone contacts you they will likely ask for content of a webpage (Why? see [WKM 1](#wanna-know-more))
2. Look at the source-code stored on your server (in the src-folder) and find the source-code of the main-webpage.
3. Create an answer and attach this source-code.
   - if you can, use the .txt file (which contains actual code)
   - if you can't send it, send the picture of the source code instead
4. Return that source-code to **Internet Connection** telling it to send it back to where it came from.
   - _How does the **Internet Connection** know where the message came from?_ (see [WKM 2](#wanna-know-more))

### Optional Information

#### Wanna know more?

1. You are a webserver. There are lots of different types of servers - imagine them as computers that serve different purposes.
   Some might store files, some store webpages (like you), others sent your emails for you.
   As a webserver your purpose is to wait for requests and respond with the corresponding webpage and/or do the corresponding task, like loggin in a user.
